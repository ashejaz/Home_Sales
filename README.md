# Home Sales

For this project, home sales data was read into a Spark DataFrame from an AWS S3 bucket:

A temporary view for the table was created and the table was then queried using SparkSQL.

The aim of this project was to compare the run-times of the following query on the regular data vs cached data vs partioned parquet data:

>_What is the "view" rating for the average price of a home (to 2 decimal places) where the home costs more than or equal to $350,000?_

The query performed on the initial home sales table returned the following output and run-time:

Then, the home sales table was cached and the query was performed again, returning the following result:

Finally, the data was partitioned on the 'date_built' column and formatted to parquet. The query was run a final time to return the following:

To conclude, we can see from the run-times that caching the table sped up the query as expected. However, when the data is partitioned and formatted to parquet, the query executes slower than it did in the 2 previous instances. This may be because this dataset is small and partitioning & parquet work best on large datasets. In this instance, partitioning may be using more resources thus slowing down the query. For this dataset, the best way to optimise query run-time would therefore be simply caching the table.
